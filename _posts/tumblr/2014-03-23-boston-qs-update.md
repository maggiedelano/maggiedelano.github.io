In the past few months, I’ve become more involved with the local [Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com/) community here in Boston. We have been running regular [show & tell](http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/events/170552132/) events, and are getting ready to try our first [QS co-lab](http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/events/170093192/), an opportunity for QSers in the area to gather and work on projects that interest them. I’m putting together a code of conduct for the meetups that I hope can be applied for the co-labs and also all future events we host.&nbsp;

I also started a meetup group for women interested in QS, known as&nbsp;[QSXX Boston](http://www.meetup.com/QSXX-Quantified-Self-Womens-Meetup-Boston/). We held our fifth meetup on March 3rd. I’ve done recaps since the first meeting, and the most recent one was featured on the [Quantified Self blog](http://quantifiedself.com/2014/03/qsxx-boston-meetup-recap/). I’m starting to plan the next QSXX event, and am excited to see where things go.
