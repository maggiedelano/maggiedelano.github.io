Back in November I wrote up a [short piece](http://web.mit.edu/maggied/Public/periodthezine.png) that was featured in [period. the zine](http://blog.ameliagreenhall.com/post/period.-the-zine-released) on a period tracking experiment I have been doing. I started tracking my periods after I quit birth control and found that my cycle started syncing up with my roommate’s after we moved in together. In the piece I chart out how the duration of my cycle changes over the months and begins to sync up. I’m still tracking now, but it’s looking like my cycle is increasing in duration again and diverging to the 28 day cycle I was on for a few months. I do think it’s pretty interesting that my period synced up, but only for a short period of time before getting longer again.

My roommate and I are going to continue our tracking, possibly with other additional data points as well, so stay tuned!
