My video on motivation for the Quantified Self. I talk about how I decided to go gluten free, how I kept myself motivated for change, and things I learned about motivation for self-experimentation in general.

Giving this talk was very rewarding and has motivated me to not only stick with my changes, but make new ones. I was also able to give advice to other people at the Meetup who are interested in changing their own behaviors.&nbsp;

Now that the videoâ€™s up, I am going to start posting here about things I am learning as I continue experimenting in the areas of Quantified Self and habit change.
