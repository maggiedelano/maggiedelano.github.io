Last weekend I went to see [The Wind Rises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises). I really enjoyed the film (the animation was absolutely gorgeous), but it certainly wasn’t without its [issues](http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2014/02/28/artistically-soaring.html). Hayao Miyazaki said this will be his last film, so to commemorate that, here’s a few of my favorite Miyazaki films. If you’d like to get into Miyazaki and are overwhelmed by the options, check out these films:

- [My Neighbor Totoro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro)
- [Princess Mononoke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Mononoke)
- [Spirited Away&nbsp;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away)
- [The Wind Rises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises)

If I had to pick only one, I’d probably pick My Neighbor Totoro, but they are all excellent.
