As mentioned in [this](http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2014-02-24-rescue-time-and-the-pomodoro-technique.html)&nbsp;post, I was busy this past week and did not get to spend dedicated time exercising for the MIT [Get Fit](http://getfit.mit.edu) competition. I did bike or walk to campus every day, though, and decided to go back and log those minutes from the week. It was hard to remember which days I biked and where I had been (even with reviewing my calendar), but then I remembered I have the [Moves app](http://www.moves-app.com/) on my phone. Moves on the iPhone 5S logs walking, running, biking and location data that give you an interesting snapshot of your day. I was able to just go back and review how long I cycled / walked each day (Iâ€™m willing to count walking I do by myself because I walk pretty briskly), and log all of my minutes for the week in about 5 minutes total.

So there you have it: Moves app, the exercise tracker for busy people.
