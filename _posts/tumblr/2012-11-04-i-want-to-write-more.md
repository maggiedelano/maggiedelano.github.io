A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon [this](http://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write "More people should write") article about why more people should write. The author discusses how writing makes one more mindful of one’s surroundings, and think critically. The article reminded me that I want to be more mindful of my life and thoughts. I realized I want to write more, not just because “more people should,” but for the following reasons:

- I think a lot.&nbsp;Writing helps me organize my thoughts.
- I want to share what I read and learn. I admire creative types and want to be a contributor in addition to a consumer.
- I want to keep track of what is going on in my life. I think back on parts of my life and wonder what I was doing and thinking during those times. I would appreciate the perspective of being able to look back at my writing.

Although these thoughts have been brewing on and off for years (and there is a graveyard full of old journals / blogs / livejournals / tumblrs out there somewhere), I think that I am in a position to put the effort in this time.

One of the biggest barriers to writing for me is starting. “Which platform will I use?” “What will I say?” “What will other people think?” “Isn’t it incredibly narcissistic to think that anyone will want to read what I think about all the time or have to say?” While I don’t have all the answers, I know that all anyone can do is put one foot in front of the other and just start. So here’s to writing more.

_Questions for those of you out there who read this: Do you also want to write more? Am I totally full of it? Any other thoughts/comments? Let me know in the comments or send me a message._
