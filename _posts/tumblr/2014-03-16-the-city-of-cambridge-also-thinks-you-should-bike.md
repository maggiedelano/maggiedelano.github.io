I was walking through Inman Square today and noticed that the City of Cambridge had an advertisement with a link to their [guide](http://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/Transportation/gettingaroundcambridge/bybike/winterbiking.aspx) to winter biking. It covers a lot of the same material as I covered&nbsp;[before](http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2014-02-17-winter-biking.html). The site also links to this great&nbsp;[PDF](http://www.abctma.com/sites/default/files/Winter-Bike-Riding-Guide.pdf)&nbsp;with a more in depth guide as to gear to buy.

One thing I didnâ€™t realize when I posted my previous guide is that the law requires using a white light in front that is visible for at least 500 feet, pedal reflectors, and a rear red reflector and/or rear red light that is visible for at least 600 feet. Click through the links above to learn more.
