I decided to use what I learned in my [Queer Theory and Politics](http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2014-04-27-readings-for-the-queer-soul.html) class this semester to draft an examination of the politics of self-tracking and Quantified Self (the group). It is still a work in progress (if you want to see it, contact me directly), but in the mean time I wanted to post a few links I found particularly helpful and/or interesting while writing.

- **[This One Does Not Go Up To Eleven: The Quantified Self Movement as an Alternative Big Data Practice](http://quantifiedself.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NafusShermanQSDraft.pdf)**&nbsp;- this piece by Dawn Nafus and Jamie Sherman suggests that not only is QS empowering for users, it is also a form of “soft” resistance against big data.
- **[Data Occupations](http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/data-occupations/)** - in which Whitney Erin Boesel critiques QS and compares it to Occupy. Both, she argues, aren’t political movements at all, but rather stores of potential energy for those movements.
- **[Living With Data: Personal Data Uses of the Quantified Self](http://saramwatson.com/post/62809054542/living-with-data-personal-data-uses-of-the-quantified)&nbsp;**- Sara M. Watson’s Master’s thesis on how personal data is used by QSers.
- **[Return of the Quantrepeneurs](http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2013/09/26/return-of-the-quantrepreneurs/)&nbsp;**- Whitney Erin Boesel lays out the QS landscape and distinguishes Quantified Self (the group) from quantified self (the practice, technologies, etc.)
- **[Forget the Quantified Self. We need to build Quantified Us.&nbsp;](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/forget-the-quantified-self-we-need-to-build-the-quantified-us/)**&nbsp;- Matthew Jordan and Nikki Pfarr call for us to move beyond self-quantification to aggregate self-tracking information.
- **[Organizing a System of 10 Billion People](http://datarella.com/organizing-a-system-of-10-billion-people/)** - Joerg Blumritt explores what QS might help achieve as it becomes more prevalent.
- **[You Are Your Data: And you should demand to use it.&nbsp;](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/11/quantified_self_self_tracking_data_we_need_a_right_to_use_it.html)&nbsp;**- This title says it all.
- **[Tracking for Health](http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/01/28/tracking-for-health/)&nbsp;**- A Pew Research project on self-tracking and tracking performed by caretakers for health purposes.
- **[Understanding Quantified-Selfers’ Practices in Collecting and Exploring Personal Data](http://research.microsoft.com/EN-US/UM/REDMOND/GROUPS/cue/publications/CHI2014-QuantifiedSelf.pdf)&nbsp;**- this recent paper examines 50+ videos from the QS website and analyzes how QSers use, visualize and learn from self-tracking data.
- **[A New Algorithmic Identity: Soft Biopolitics and the Modulation of Control](http://tcs.sagepub.com/content/28/6/164.abstract)**&nbsp;- This paper examines how identities online are created by algorithms, and suggests that this is creating “soft” biopolitics and biopower.
- **[Quantified Sex: A Critical Analysis of Sexual and Reproductive Self- tracking Apps](https://www.academia.edu/6951636/Quantified_sex_a_critical_analysis_of_sexual_and_reproductive_self-tracking_apps)&nbsp;**- Deborah Lupton shows how sexual and reproductive self-tracking apps reinforce norms about male and female sexualities and calls for a “queering” of such apps.
