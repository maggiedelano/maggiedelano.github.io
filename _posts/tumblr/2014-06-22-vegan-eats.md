I’ve been eating [vegan during the week](http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2014-05-05-reflections-after-a-month-of-veganism-during-the.html-week) for almost three months now. I thought it would be pretty challenging to eat vegan and also purchase most of my meals (I’ve been busy, and haven’t had much time for cooking). Fortunately, though, I’ve found a few different vegan options at restaurants in Cambridge and Somerville that I really like. Here are some of my current favorites:

- **[The Atticus](http://bloc11.com/menu/sandwiches/) at Bloc 11 Cafe**&nbsp; **-&nbsp;** buffalo tempeh with avocado spread, tomato, red onion, and greens on rye. I tried this for the first time two weeks ago, and love it. Ask for it toasted.
- **[Chickpea Fritter](http://www.cloverfoodlab.com/food/) at Clover** - hummus, israeli salad, pickles, falafel, pickled vegetables and tahini. Crunchy and amazing.&nbsp;
- **Chana Masala and Toor Dal at [Cafe Spice](http://dining.mit.edu/venues-menus/cafespice)**&nbsp;- chickpeas, yellow lentils, and rice. Simple but probably one of my favorite lunch time options.

Most chain restaurants also have a vegan option, or you can order a vegetarian option without cheese. The sofritas from Chipotle is delicious, as is the hummus and veggie sandwich from Cosi.
