    <p>I’ve been recovering from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-concussion_syndrome">Post-Concussion Syndrome</a> for the past 7 weeks or so. Now that I’ve been getting back to work, I wanted to share a few things that I’ve found particularly helpful for keeping up with my work without hurting my brain.</p>

<p>The first things I’ve learned to do better are to ask for help and delegate where I can. I’m trying to focus on tasks that only I can do. I’m also learning to keep emails more brief and not send essays/rants that require a long time to compose (if I need to, I set up a meeting or a quick phone call). I’ve also avoided browsing on social media as I tend to get sucked in easily and need to save my precious screen time for work.</p>

<p>I downloaded an app called <a href="http://iamfutureproof.com/tools/awareness/">awareness</a> (mac) that gives you a soft reminder (the sound of a meditation bowl ringing) whenever your designated work duration is up, and automatically resets itself when you’ve taken a break for your designated break duration. It also shows how long you’ve been using your computer without a break in the task bar. I found this helps keep me from idly using my computer and reminds me to give my eyes and brain a short screen break (&gt; 3 minutes) every 20 minutes or so.</p>

<p>I’ve also been sporting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BQ7KBV4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">computer glasses</a> when I look at any sort of screen for more than a few seconds, which help reduce eye strain and definitely seem to help prevent my headaches. I didn’t have an appreciation for how aggressive projector screens and fluorescent lights are until my head injury, and these really help.</p>

<p>I try to charge my laptop up for the day, and then use it on battery power throughout the day. I try to plan out any writing or work I have to do on a piece of paper before I start so I’m focused on the task at hand when I open my laptop up. If I run through the battery in a day, it’s a sign that I should consider taking the rest of the day easy to give myself a rest.</p>

<p>If anyone has other thoughts on more efficient/mindful computer use, I’d love to hear more.</p>
