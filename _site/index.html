<p>I’m an Assistant Professor of Engineering at <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a>. For my <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/115636">PhD dissertation</a>, I built a <a href="http://www.analog.com/en/landing-pages/001/medrc.html">fluid status monitor</a> for patients with congestive heart failure with Professor Charlie Sodini. My work was part of the Medical Electronic Device Realization Center (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/medrc/">MEDRC</a>) at MIT. For my master’s <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/76811">thesis</a>, I developed a wearable cardiac monitor that measures single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and three axis acceleration data for up to one week while the user carries out their daily activities. I have also worked as a Teaching Assistant and Electrical Engineering Instructor for MIT’s <a href="http://web.mit.edu/2.75/">Medical Device Design class</a>, where I mentored group projects and designed and supervised an ECG lab.</p>

<p>While in Boston I was a co-organizer of Quantified Self Boston and started the Quantified Self Boston Women’s Meetup. I have given multiple talks about my self-tracking experiences, including a <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2013/12/maggie-delano-ecg-activity-tracking/">talk</a> at QS13 on my experiences wearing my cardiac monitor and another <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2015/08/maggie-delano-building-back/">talk</a> at QS15 about my experiences recovering from a concussion. I have also been involved in other diversity efforts in the Quantified Self community, including writing the first QS Code of Conduct and organizing a sponsorship program for QS15.</p>

<p>Both my research and my experiences with the Quantified Self community have stimulated my interest in inclusive and anti-oppressive design. My writings on this topic thus far include an article on the <a href="https://medium.com/@maggied/i-tried-tracking-my-period-and-it-was-even-worse-than-i-could-have-imagined-bb46f869f45">design of period tracking apps</a>, and the <a href="https://logicmag.io/justice/the-world-is-a-prison/">perils of electronic monitoring</a>.
