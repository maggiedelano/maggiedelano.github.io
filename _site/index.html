<p>I’m an Assistant Professor of Engineering at <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/" target="_blank">Swarthmore College</a>. For my <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/115636" target="_blank">PhD dissertation</a>, I built a <a href="http://www.analog.com/en/landing-pages/001/medrc.html" target="_blank">fluid status monitor</a> for patients with congestive heart failure with Professor Charlie Sodini. My work was part of the Medical Electronic Device Realization Center (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/medrc/" target="_blank">MEDRC</a>) at MIT. For my master’s <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/76811" target="_blank">thesis</a>, I developed a wearable cardiac monitor that measures single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and three axis acceleration data for up to one week while the user carries out their daily activities. I also worked as a Teaching Assistant and Electrical Engineering Instructor for MIT’s <a href="http://web.mit.edu/2.75/" target="_blank">Medical Device Design class</a>, where I mentored group projects and designed and supervised an ECG lab.</p>

<p>I was a co-organizer of Quantified Self Boston and started the Quantified Self Boston Women’s Meetup. I have given multiple talks about my self-tracking experiences, including a <a href="https://quantifiedself.com/blog/maggie-delano-ecg-activity-tracking/" target="_blank">talk</a> at QS13 on my experiences wearing my cardiac monitor and another <a href="https://quantifiedself.com/show-and-tell/?project=787" target="_blank">talk</a> at QS15 about my experiences recovering from a concussion. I presented my biggest self-tracking project yet at QS18, where I shared data from <a href="https://quantifiedself.com/show-and-tell/?project=1112" target="_blank">almost 5,000 pomodoros</a> completed over the course of my PhD. I have also been involved in diversity efforts in the Quantified Self community, including writing the first QS Code of Conduct and organizing a sponsorship program for QS15.</p>

<p>Both my research and my experiences with the Quantified Self community have stimulated my interest in inclusive and anti-oppressive design. My writings on this topic thus far include an article on the <a href="https://medium.com/@maggied/i-tried-tracking-my-period-and-it-was-even-worse-than-i-could-have-imagined-bb46f869f45" target="_blank">design of period tracking apps</a>, and the <a href="https://logicmag.io/justice/the-world-is-a-prison/" target="_blank">perils of electronic monitoring</a>. I’ll be piloting an Inclusive Engineering Design <a href="https://catalog.swarthmore.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=7&amp;coid=71906" title="Inclusive Engineering Design course" target="_blank">course</a> in Fall 2020; you can follow along on the <a href="https://www.engineeringinclusively.com" title="Engineering Inclusively Blog" target="_blank">Engineering Inclusively Blog</a>.
