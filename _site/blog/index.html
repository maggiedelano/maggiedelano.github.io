For the next few weeks I am experimenting with a <a href="/garden">digital garden</a>, focusing on curating pages and resources rather than writing discretized updates. Follow along there if you’d like to see what I’m up to. It took a little while longer to setup than I would have liked, so I’m sharing how I set it up to save others a headache.</p>

        </h3><p>Greetings from my new website! I had a little time this weekend, and to distract myself from the hellhole that is 2020, I decided to port my previous site (which was mostly handwritten in HTML with a header and some organization using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" title="bootstrap">bootstrap</a> and hosted on Swarthmore’s servers) to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>, with hosting on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a>. I wanted to be able to combine my website and former tumblr blog into one, and Jekyll seemed like an easy way to do that. I considered porting to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" title="Gatsby">Gatsby</a>, but I know nothing about <a href="https://reactjs.org/" title="React">React</a> or <a href="https://graphql.org/" title="GraphQL">GraphQL</a> and learning seemed like much more than a weekend project. As it was, I had “fun” trying to figure out how to vertically align my photo and my contact information on the main page, while also being responsive / looking good on both desktop and mobile, so it seems 12 year old software is advanced enough for my limited web programming skills. But hey, I did finally learn the basics of CSS. Here’s a tour of the changes I made.</p>

        </h3><p>Four and a half years ago I wrote <a href="https://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2014-06-10-doing-whats-important.html">this post</a> about my priorities and doing what was important to me at the time as a graduate student in the middle of her PhD. Fast forward to today, and I defended my PhD (over a year ago!) and have started a tenure track assistant professor position at Swarthmore College (hurray!). The last year has been a total whirlwind; I moved in early January 2018, turned in my thesis a few weeks later, and then started teaching about 4 days after that. I’ve been getting used to a new job, a new city, and just closed on a condo in December. It’s like jamming a whole ton of adulting all into one year.</p>

            Transformative Books (Non-fiction edition)
          </a>
        </h3><p>While discussing book reading habits with a few people recently, I came to the realization that I tend to read a lot of non-fiction, and that non-fiction has shaped how I live my life and view the world. I wanted to share some books that I’ve read (skewed in favor of the past few years, when I started keeping better track of what I’ve read) that I have found particularly meaningful for me.</p>

        </h3><p>As mentioned in <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2014-02-24-rescue-time-and-the-pomodoro-technique.html">this</a> post, I was busy this past week and did not get to spend dedicated time exercising for the MIT <a href="http://getfit.mit.edu">Get Fit</a> competition. I did bike or walk to campus every day, though, and decided to go back and log those minutes from the week. It was hard to remember which days I biked and where I had been (even with reviewing my calendar), but then I remembered I have the <a href="http://www.moves-app.com/">Moves app</a> on my phone. Moves on the iPhone 5S logs walking, running, biking and location data that give you an interesting snapshot of your day. I was able to just go back and review how long I cycled / walked each day (I’m willing to count walking I do by myself because I walk pretty briskly), and log all of my minutes for the week in about 5 minutes total.</p>

            Rescue Time and the Pomodoro Technique
          </a>
        </h3><p>I have tracked my computer usage with <a href="http://rescuetime.com">Rescue Time</a> for several years now, but don’t always pay a ton of attention to it. This past week I decided to drop as many of my obligations as I could to focus on pumping a next generation board out for my thesis. I use the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro technique</a>, relying on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/strict-workflow/cgmnfnmlficgeijcalkgnnkigkefkbhd/reviews?hl=en">Strict Workflow</a> chrome extension to keep me honest about minimizing distractions. I set the extension up to block stereotypically distracting sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) but also my email and calendar so I really have no choice but to do work for the pomodoro duration (25 minutes). I then take a 5 minute break. After four pomodoros, I allow myself a 15 minute break.</p>

        </h3><p>I moved near Inman Square this past June, which is a great location about 1.3 miles from my lab. I promised myself that in exchange for moving closer to campus, I would start biking everywhere. I started bike commuting over the summer, and found that I love it because it’s pretty much the fastest way for me to get around without a car. </p>

While Altium is definitely a more professional tool, I found the startup time for my first design to be a bit longer than I would have liked. Below is a list of a few little things that seem simple in theory, but were non-intuitive for me to figure out the first time around (even with the help of google and the tutorial pdfs and videos).</p>

        </h3><p>Back in November I wrote up a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/maggied/Public/periodthezine.png">short piece</a> that was featured in <a href="http://blog.ameliagreenhall.com/post/period.-the-zine-released">period. the zine</a> on a period tracking experiment I have been doing. I started tracking my periods after I quit birth control and found that my cycle started syncing up with my roommate’s after we moved in together. In the piece I chart out how the duration of my cycle changes over the months and begins to sync up. I’m still tracking now, but it’s looking like my cycle is increasing in duration again and diverging to the 28 day cycle I was on for a few months. I do think it’s pretty interesting that my period synced up, but only for a short period of time before getting longer again.</p>

I knew that if I allowed myself to make a choice - to eat gluten or not to eat it - I’d inevitably wind up eating it. Even if I made an a priori decision to limit my intake, each time I was confronted with gluten, I’d have to decide: to eat it or not to.</p>

I realized I want to write more, not just because “more people should,” but for the following reasons:</p>
