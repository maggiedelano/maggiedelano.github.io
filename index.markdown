I'm an Assistant Professor of Engineering at [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu/){:target="_blank"}. For my [PhD dissertation](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/115636){:target="_blank"}, I built a [fluid status monitor](http://www.analog.com/en/landing-pages/001/medrc.html){:target="_blank"} for patients with congestive heart failure with Professor Charlie Sodini. My work was part of the Medical Electronic Device Realization Center ([MEDRC](http://web.mit.edu/medrc/){:target="_blank"}) at MIT. For my master's [thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/76811){:target="_blank"}, I developed a wearable cardiac monitor that measures single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and three axis acceleration data for up to one week while the user carries out their daily activities. I also worked as a Teaching Assistant and Electrical Engineering Instructor for MIT's [Medical Device Design class](http://web.mit.edu/2.75/){:target="_blank"}, where I mentored group projects and designed and supervised an ECG lab.

I was a co-organizer of Quantified Self Boston and started the Quantified Self Boston Women's Meetup. I have given multiple talks about my self-tracking experiences, including a [talk](https://quantifiedself.com/blog/maggie-delano-ecg-activity-tracking/){:target="_blank"} at QS13 on my experiences wearing my cardiac monitor and another [talk](https://quantifiedself.com/show-and-tell/?project=787){:target="_blank"} at QS15 about my experiences recovering from a concussion. I presented my biggest self-tracking project yet at QS18, where I shared data from [almost 5,000 pomodoros](https://quantifiedself.com/show-and-tell/?project=1112){:target="_blank"} completed over the course of my PhD. I have also been involved in diversity efforts in the Quantified Self community, including writing the first QS Code of Conduct and organizing a sponsorship program for QS15.

Both my research and my experiences with the Quantified Self community have stimulated my interest in inclusive and anti-oppressive design. My writings on this topic thus far include an article on the [design of period tracking apps](https://medium.com/@maggied/i-tried-tracking-my-period-and-it-was-even-worse-than-i-could-have-imagined-bb46f869f45){:target="_blank"}, and the [perils of electronic monitoring](https://logicmag.io/justice/the-world-is-a-prison/){:target="_blank"}. I'll be piloting an Inclusive Engineering Design [course](https://catalog.swarthmore.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=7&coid=71906 "Inclusive Engineering Design course"){:target="_blank"} in Fall 2020; you can follow along on the [Engineering Inclusively Blog](https://www.engineeringinclusively.com "Engineering Inclusively Blog"){:target="_blank"}.
