I'm an Associate Professor of Engineering at [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests include the development of monitoring systems for chronic diseases and inclusive engineering design. For my [PhD dissertation](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/115636){:target="_blank"}, I built a [fluid status monitor](http://www.analog.com/en/landing-pages/001/medrc.html){:target="_blank"} for patients with congestive heart failure with Professor Charlie Sodini.  While in graduate school, I was also co-organizer of Quantified Self Boston and started the Quantified Self Boston Women's Meetup. You can find a list of my publications [here](/publications) and a list of the courses I've taught [here](/teaching). 

My current projects include:
- Human subjects studies and simulations to better understand the influence of skin tone and perfusion on pulse oximeter accuracy
- Interdisciplinary collaborations, including one about improving racial bias in pulse oximetry measurements and another about sex/gender in medical machine learning
- Threat modeling for detecting unwanted location tracking (see [Internet Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dult-threat-model/){:target="_blank"})
- A project connecting gender based violence service providers and technology and security professionals to tackle tech abuse (see [Tech Abuse Roster](https://sites.google.com/asu.edu/roster/home){:target="_blank"})

Both my research and my experiences with the Quantified Self community have stimulated my interest in inclusive and anti-oppressive design. In Fall 2020, I taught the first iteration of my [inclusive engineering design course](https://www.notion.so/ENGR-053-FA20-aab6498961fe4d3d85c9d9f31e0cdbef "ENGR 053"){:target="_blank"}, a course that is "half seminar, half design studio."  I have co-authored several papers on inclusive design, including articles about [adversarial](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02048){:target="_blank"} [machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10302){:target="_blank"}, along with research into the use of sex/gender data in [medical machine learning applications](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2022.100534). I have also written articles for a general audience, such as an article on the [design of period tracking apps](https://medium.com/@maggied/i-tried-tracking-my-period-and-it-was-even-worse-than-i-could-have-imagined-bb46f869f45){:target="_blank"}, and on privacy concerns with respect to [period trackers post-Dobbs](https://medium.com/@Kendra_Serra/fear-uncertainty-and-period-trackers-340ab8fdff74){:target="_blank"}.

For full details on my research, teaching and writing, check out [my CV](cv_mkd.pdf). I'm also experimenting with a digital garden for sharing curated content and resources, which you can find [here](/garden).
