I"<p>I have been enrolled in the <a href="https://hst.mit.edu/academics/gems">Graduate Education in Medical Sciences</a>program for the past year. This Spring, I am doing a <a href="https://hst.mit.edu/academics/course/hst-240-translational-medicine-preceptorship">Translational Medicine Preceptorship</a>Â with <a href="http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/61067">Dr. Maulik Majmudar</a>. I just finished my first week, and it has already been an amazing experience.Â I spent two days this week watching <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/nuclear-stress-test/basics/definition/prc-20012978">Nuclear Imaging Stress Tests</a>Â and then two more days in the <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cath/">Cardiac CatheterizationÂ Lab</a>, both at MGH. Iâ€™ve learned a ton already, and wanted to write up a few interesting things I learned about stress testing.</p>
