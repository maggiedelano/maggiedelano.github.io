<p>I‚Äôm an Associate Professor of Engineering at <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/" target="_blank">Swarthmore College</a>. My research interests include the development of monitoring systems for chronic diseases and inclusive engineering design. For my <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/115636" target="_blank">PhD dissertation</a>, I built a <a href="http://www.analog.com/en/landing-pages/001/medrc.html" target="_blank">fluid status monitor</a> for patients with congestive heart failure with Professor Charlie Sodini.  While in graduate school, I was also co-organizer of Quantified Self Boston and started the Quantified Self Boston Women‚Äôs Meetup. You can find a list of my publications <a href="/publications">here</a> and a list of the courses I‚Äôve taught <a href="/teaching">here</a>.</p>

<p>My current projects include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Human subjects studies and simulations to better understand the influence of skin tone and perfusion on pulse oximeter accuracy</li>
  <li>Interdisciplinary collaborations, including one about improving racial bias in pulse oximetry measurements and another about sex/gender in medical machine learning</li>
  <li>Threat modeling for detecting unwanted location tracking (see <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dult-threat-model/" target="_blank">Internet Draft</a>)</li>
  <li>A project connecting gender based violance service providers and technology and security professionals to tackle tech abuse (see <a href="https://sites.google.com/asu.edu/roster/home" target="_blank">Tech Abuse Roster</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both my research and my experiences with the Quantified Self community have stimulated my interest in inclusive and anti-oppressive design. In Fall 2020, I taught the first iteration of my <a href="https://www.notion.so/ENGR-053-FA20-aab6498961fe4d3d85c9d9f31e0cdbef" title="ENGR 053" target="_blank">inclusive engineering design course</a>, a course that is ‚Äúhalf seminar, half design studio.‚Äù  I have co-authored several papers on inclusive design, including articles about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02048" target="_blank">adversarial</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10302" target="_blank">machine learning</a>, along with research into the use of sex/gender data in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2022.100534">medical machine learning applications</a>. I have also written articles for a general audience, such as an article on the <a href="https://medium.com/@maggied/i-tried-tracking-my-period-and-it-was-even-worse-than-i-could-have-imagined-bb46f869f45" target="_blank">design of period tracking apps</a>, and on privacy concerns with respect to <a href="https://medium.com/@Kendra_Serra/fear-uncertainty-and-period-trackers-340ab8fdff74" target="_blank">period trackers post-Dobbs</a>.</p>
