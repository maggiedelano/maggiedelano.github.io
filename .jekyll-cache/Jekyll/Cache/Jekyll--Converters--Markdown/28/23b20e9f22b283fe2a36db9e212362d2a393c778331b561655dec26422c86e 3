I"”<p>While discussing book reading habits with a few people recently, I came to the realization that I tend to read a lot of non-fiction, and that non-fiction has shaped how I live my life and view the world. I wanted to share some books that Iâ€™ve read (skewed in favor of the past few years, when I started keeping better track of what Iâ€™ve read) that I have found particularly meaningful for me.</p>
