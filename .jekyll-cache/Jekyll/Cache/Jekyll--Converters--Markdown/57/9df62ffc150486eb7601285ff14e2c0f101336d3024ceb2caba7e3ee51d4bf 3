I"N<p>About a year ago, I wrote <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2013-06-06-knowing-whats-important.html">this post</a> about identifying things that are important to me. Now that a year has passed, I’d like to take the time to reflect both on what I wrote a year ago and how I’ve been doing for the past year.</p>
