I"d<p>In the past few months, I’ve become more involved with the local <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> community here in Boston. We have been running regular <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/events/170552132/">show &amp; tell</a> events, and are getting ready to try our first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/events/170093192/">QS co-lab</a>, an opportunity for QSers in the area to gather and work on projects that interest them. I’m putting together a code of conduct for the meetups that I hope can be applied for the co-labs and also all future events we host. </p>
