            Enough with the beeping: Apple needs to enable active Bluetooth scanning on iOS to prevent stalking Using Apple AirTags
          </a>
        </h3><h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/airtag/">Apple AirTags</a> are small Bluetooth Low Energy tracking devices that can fit in a pocket or wallet. While AirTags are intended to be used to find misplaced and lost items, they also provide a cheap and incredibly effective way to track someone without their consent. AirTags use Apple‚Äôs <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/725842/what-is-apples-find-my-network/">Find My Network</a>, enabled by default on Apple products like iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers, to update the network as to the device‚Äôs current location. However, unlike previous devices such as <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/">Tile</a>, which had sporadic coverage even in urban areas, the widespread coverage of the Find My Network (i.e. any Apple device that has not actively opted out), means that these devices are perfect tools for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/11/technology/airtags-gps-surveillance.html">stalking</a>.</p>

            Summer Research Collaboration in Roam Research
          </a>
        </h3><p>As a professor at a small liberal arts college, most of my research gets done with a fresh group of 2-4 undergraduate students over the course of 10 weeks each summer. These students have to quickly ramp up on part of my research and make a contribution all before August vacation. This summer I wanted to develop a workflow that would enable students to get onboarded as quickly as possible, get help when they needed it (while leaving me some time to get my own stuff done), and also document their work for me and the next round of students that join in the future. I decided to conduct an experiment where my students and I used a combination of the instant messaging service <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> and the collaborative notetaking web app <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> to conduct our research. I found the combination of real time messaging in Slack with the capability to record meeting notes and workflows in Roam to be a great combination that was easy for students to use and helpful for their planning and reflection if set up appropriately.</p>

            Website Revamp!

        </h3><p>Greetings from my new website! I had a little time this weekend, and to distract myself from the hellhole that is 2020, I decided to port my previous site (which was mostly handwritten in HTML with a header and some organization using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" title="bootstrap">bootstrap</a> and hosted on Swarthmore‚Äôs servers) to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>, with hosting on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a>. I wanted to be able to combine my website and former tumblr blog into one, and Jekyll seemed like an easy way to do that. I considered porting to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" title="Gatsby">Gatsby</a>, but I know nothing about <a href="https://reactjs.org/" title="React">React</a> or <a href="https://graphql.org/" title="GraphQL">GraphQL</a> and learning seemed like much more than a weekend project. As it was, I had ‚Äúfun‚Äù trying to figure out how to vertically align my photo and my contact information on the main page, while also being responsive / looking good on both desktop and mobile, so it seems 12 year old software is advanced enough for my limited web programming skills. But hey, I did finally learn the basics of CSS. Here‚Äôs a tour of the changes I made.</p>

        </h3><p>Four and a half years ago I wrote <a href="https://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2014-06-10-doing-whats-important.html">this post</a> about my priorities and doing what was important to me at the time as a graduate student in the middle of her PhD. Fast forward to today, and I defended my PhD (over a year ago!) and have started a tenure track assistant professor position at Swarthmore College (hurray!). The last year has been a total whirlwind; I moved in early January 2018, turned in my thesis a few weeks later, and then started teaching about 4 days after that. I‚Äôve been getting used to a new job, a new city, and just closed on a condo in December. It‚Äôs like jamming a whole ton of adulting all into one year.</p>

            Rescue Time and the Pomodoro Technique
          </a>
        </h3><p>I have tracked my computer usage with¬†<a href="http://rescuetime.com">Rescue Time</a>¬†for several years now, but don‚Äôt always pay a ton of attention to it. This past week I decided to drop as many of my obligations as I could to focus on pumping a next generation board out for my thesis. I use the¬†<a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro technique</a>, relying on the¬†<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/strict-workflow/cgmnfnmlficgeijcalkgnnkigkefkbhd/reviews?hl=en">Strict Workflow</a>¬†chrome extension to keep me honest about minimizing distractions. I set the extension up to block stereotypically distracting sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) but also my email and calendar so I really have no choice but to do work for the pomodoro duration (25 minutes). I then take a 5 minute break. After four pomodoros, I allow myself a 15 minute break.</p>

        </h3><p>I moved near Inman Square this past June, which is a great location about 1.3 miles from my lab. I promised myself that in exchange for moving closer to campus, I would start biking everywhere. I started bike commuting over the summer, and found that I love it because it‚Äôs pretty much the fastest way for me to get around without a car.¬†</p>

While Altium is definitely a more professional tool, I found the startup time for my first design to be a bit longer than I would have liked. Below is a list of a few little things that seem simple in theory, but were non-intuitive for me to figure out the first time around (even with the help of google and the tutorial pdfs and videos).</p>

        </h3><p>Back in November I wrote up a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/maggied/Public/periodthezine.png">short piece</a> that was featured in <a href="http://blog.ameliagreenhall.com/post/period.-the-zine-released">period. the zine</a> on a period tracking experiment I have been doing. I started tracking my periods after I quit birth control and found that my cycle started syncing up with my roommate‚Äôs after we moved in together. In the piece I chart out how the duration of my cycle changes over the months and begins to sync up. I‚Äôm still tracking now, but it‚Äôs looking like my cycle is increasing in duration again and diverging to the 28 day cycle I was on for a few months. I do think it‚Äôs pretty interesting that my period synced up, but only for a short period of time before getting longer again.</p>

Before I get into the details, I want to thank Gary Wolf, Ernesto Ramirez, Kate Farnady, Marcia Seidler, Steven Jonas, and Amelia Greenhall for organizing the conference, helping me with my presentation, and generally being encouraging and awesome people.</p>

        </h3><p>When I decided to go gluten free, I didn‚Äôt think it would be easy. Pasta, beer, bagels. I seriously loved eating wheat. I knew that if I allowed myself to make a choice - to eat gluten or not to eat it - I‚Äôd inevitably wind up eating it. Even if I made an a priori decision to limit my intake, each time I was confronted with gluten, I‚Äôd have to decide: to eat it or not to.</p>

The author discusses how writing makes one more mindful of one‚Äôs surroundings, and think critically. The article reminded me that I want to be more mindful of my life and thoughts. I realized I want to write more, not just because ‚Äúmore people should,‚Äù but for the following reasons:</p>
