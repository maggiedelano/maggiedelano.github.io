I"Í<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2014-03-23-boston-qs-update.html">this</a> post, I have been working on putting together a Code of Conduct for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/">Boston QS</a>â€™s meetups. We announced our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/pages/Code_of_Conduct/">Code Of Conduct</a> Thursday just in time for one of our events. Iâ€™ve included the full text of the announcement below.Â </p>
