I"?<p>In the past few months, I’ve become more involved with the local <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> community here in Boston. We have been running regular <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/events/170552132/">show &amp; tell</a> events, and are getting ready to try our first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/events/170093192/">QS co-lab</a>, an opportunity for QSers in the area to gather and work on projects that interest them. I’m putting together a code of conduct for the meetups that I hope can be applied for the co-labs and also all future events we host. </p>

<p>I also started a meetup group for women interested in QS, known as <a href="http://www.meetup.com/QSXX-Quantified-Self-Womens-Meetup-Boston/">QSXX Boston</a>. We held our fifth meetup on March 3rd. I’ve done recaps since the first meeting, and the most recent one was featured on the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2014/03/qsxx-boston-meetup-recap/">Quantified Self blog</a>. I’m starting to plan the next QSXX event, and am excited to see where things go.</p>
