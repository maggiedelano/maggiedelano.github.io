I"î<p>About a week ago I had the privilege of attending the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/conference/San-Francisco-2013/">Quantified SelfÂ Global Conference</a> in San Francisco.Â It was an amazing and thought provoking three days. Before I get into the details, I want to thank Gary Wolf, Ernesto Ramirez, Kate Farnady, Marcia Seidler, Steven Jonas, and Amelia Greenhall for organizing the conference, helping me with my presentation, and generally being encouraging and awesome people.</p>
