<p>I‚Äôm an Assistant Professor of Engineering at <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/" target="_blank">Swarthmore College</a>. My research interests include the development of monitoring systems for chronic diseases and inclusive engineering design. You can find a list of my publications <a href="/publications">here</a> and a list of the courses I‚Äôve taught <a href="/teaching">here</a>. For my <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/115636" target="_blank">PhD dissertation</a>, I built a <a href="http://www.analog.com/en/landing-pages/001/medrc.html" target="_blank">fluid status monitor</a> for patients with congestive heart failure with Professor Charlie Sodini. While in graduate school, I was also co-organizer of Quantified Self Boston and started the Quantified Self Boston Women‚Äôs Meetup.</p>

<p>Both my research and my experiences with the Quantified Self community have stimulated my interest in inclusive and anti-oppressive design. In Fall 2021 I piloted the first iteration of my <a href="https://www.notion.so/ENGR-053-FA20-aab6498961fe4d3d85c9d9f31e0cdbef" title="ENGR 053" target="_blank">inclusive engineering design course</a>, a course that is ‚Äúhalf seminar, half design studio.‚Äù  I also co-authored two <a href="/publications">publications</a> on inclusive design, and have written other articles for a general audience, such as an article on the <a href="https://medium.com/@maggied/i-tried-tracking-my-period-and-it-was-even-worse-than-i-could-have-imagined-bb46f869f45" target="_blank">design of period tracking apps</a>, and on the <a href="https://logicmag.io/justice/the-world-is-a-prison/" target="_blank">perils of electronic monitoring</a>.</p>

<p>For full details on my research, teaching and writing, check out <a href="cv_mkd.pdf">my CV</a>. I‚Äôm also experimenting with a digital garden for sharing curated content and resources, which you can find <a href="/garden">here</a>.</p>
