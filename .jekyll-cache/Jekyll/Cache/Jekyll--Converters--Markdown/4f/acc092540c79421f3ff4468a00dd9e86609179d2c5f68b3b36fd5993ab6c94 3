I"<p>A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write" title="More people should write">this</a> article about why more people should write. The author discusses how writing makes one more mindful of one’s surroundings, and think critically. The article reminded me that I want to be more mindful of my life and thoughts. I realized I want to write more, not just because “more people should,” but for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I think a lot. Writing helps me organize my thoughts.</li>
  <li>I want to share what I read and learn. I admire creative types and want to be a contributor in addition to a consumer.</li>
  <li>I want to keep track of what is going on in my life. I think back on parts of my life and wonder what I was doing and thinking during those times. I would appreciate the perspective of being able to look back at my writing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although these thoughts have been brewing on and off for years (and there is a graveyard full of old journals / blogs / livejournals / tumblrs out there somewhere), I think that I am in a position to put the effort in this time.</p>

<p>One of the biggest barriers to writing for me is starting. “Which platform will I use?” “What will I say?” “What will other people think?” “Isn’t it incredibly narcissistic to think that anyone will want to read what I think about all the time or have to say?” While I don’t have all the answers, I know that all anyone can do is put one foot in front of the other and just start. So here’s to writing more.</p>

<p><em>Questions for those of you out there who read this: Do you also want to write more? Am I totally full of it? Any other thoughts/comments? Let me know in the comments or send me a message.</em></p>
