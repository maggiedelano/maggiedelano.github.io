I"„<p>When I decided to go gluten free, I didnâ€™t think it would be easy. Pasta, beer, bagels. I seriously loved eating wheat. I knew that if I allowed myself to make a choice - to eat gluten or not to eat it - Iâ€™d inevitably wind up eating it. Even if I made an a priori decision to limit my intake, each time I was confronted with gluten, Iâ€™d have to decide: to eat it or not to.</p>
