I" <p>Iâ€™ve been eating <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2014-05-05-reflections-after-a-month-of-veganism-during-the.html-week">vegan during the week</a> for almost three months now. I thought it would be pretty challenging to eat vegan and also purchase most of my meals (Iâ€™ve been busy, and havenâ€™t had much time for cooking). Fortunately, though, Iâ€™ve found a few different vegan options at restaurants in Cambridge and Somerville that I really like. Here are some of my current favorites:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://bloc11.com/menu/sandwiches/">The Atticus</a> at Bloc 11 Cafe</strong>Â  <strong>-Â </strong> buffalo tempeh with avocado spread, tomato, red onion, and greens on rye. I tried this for the first time two weeks ago, and love it. Ask for it toasted.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.cloverfoodlab.com/food/">Chickpea Fritter</a> at Clover</strong> - hummus, israeli salad, pickles, falafel, pickled vegetables and tahini. Crunchy and amazing.Â </li>
  <li><strong>Chana Masala and Toor Dal at <a href="http://dining.mit.edu/venues-menus/cafespice">Cafe Spice</a></strong>Â - chickpeas, yellow lentils, and rice. Simple but probably one of my favorite lunch time options.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most chain restaurants also have a vegan option, or you can order a vegetarian option without cheese. The sofritas from Chipotle is delicious, as is the hummus and veggie sandwich from Cosi.</p>
