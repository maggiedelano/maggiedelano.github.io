I"÷<p>Last weekend I went to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises">The Wind Rises</a>. I really enjoyed the film (the animation was absolutely gorgeous), but it certainly wasnâ€™t without its <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2014/02/28/artistically-soaring.html">issues</a>. Hayao Miyazaki said this will be his last film, so to commemorate that, hereâ€™s a few of my favorite Miyazaki films. If youâ€™d like to get into Miyazaki and are overwhelmed by the options, check out these films:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro">My Neighbor Totoro</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Mononoke">Princess Mononoke</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away">Spirited AwayÂ </a></li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises">The Wind Rises</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If I had to pick only one, Iâ€™d probably pick My Neighbor Totoro, but they are all excellent.</p>
