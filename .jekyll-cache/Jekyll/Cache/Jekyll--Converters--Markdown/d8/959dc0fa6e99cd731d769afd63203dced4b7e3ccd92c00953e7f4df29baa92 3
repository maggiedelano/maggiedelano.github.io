I"<p>Greetings from my new website! I had a little time this weekend, and to distract myself from the hellhole that is 2020, I decided to port my previous site (which was mostly handwritten in HTML with a header and some organization using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" title="bootstrap">bootstrap</a> and hosted on Swarthmore’s servers) to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>, with hosting on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a>. I wanted to be able to combine my website and former tumblr blog into one, and Jekyll seemed like an easy way to do that. I considered porting to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" title="Gatsby">Gatsby</a>, but I know nothing about <a href="https://reactjs.org/" title="React">React</a> or <a href="https://graphql.org/" title="GraphQL">GraphQL</a> and learning seemed like much more than a weekend project. As it was, I had “fun” trying to figure out how to vertically align my photo and my contact information on the main page, while also being responsive / looking good on both desktop and mobile, so it seems 12 year old software is advanced enough for my limited web programming skills. But hey, I did finally learn the basics of CSS. Here’s a tour of the changes I made.</p>
