I"7<p>As a professor at a small liberal arts college, most of my research gets done with a fresh group of 2-4 undergraduate students over the course of 10 weeks each summer. These stude to ramp up on part of my research and make a contribution before August vacation. This summer I wanted to develop a workflow that would enable students to get onboarded as quickly as possible, get help when they needed it (while leaving me some time to get my own stuff done), and also document their work for me and the next round of students that join in the future. I decided to conduct an experiment where my students and I used a combination of the instant messaging service <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> and the collaborative notetaking web app <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> to conduct our research. I found the combination of real time messaging in Slack with the capability to record meeting notes and workflows in Roam to be a great combination that was easy for students to use and helpful for their planning and reflection if set up appropriately.</p>
