I"å<p><em>Update 2022-02-21: After posting about this on <a href="https://twitter.com/maggied/status/1495863458654568454">twitter</a>, Glenn Fleishman <a href="https://twitter.com/maggied/status/1495885817671294978">pointed out</a> that Apple has implemented this feature in a iOS 15.2 Beta, but it has not made it to production. This feature would enable active tracking on iOS using built-in features, but still prevent third parties from implementing similar services on iOS.</em></p>
