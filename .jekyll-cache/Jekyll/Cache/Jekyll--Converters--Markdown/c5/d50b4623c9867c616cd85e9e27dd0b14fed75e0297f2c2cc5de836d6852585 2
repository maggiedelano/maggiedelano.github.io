I"Ž<p>I have been enrolled in <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/WGS/sp14/WGS.700/index.html">WGS.700</a>, a course on queer theory and politics. As a queer person, I took the course because I was interested in learning more about the fundamental works that structure queer activism today, and to become equipped with theoretical knowledge of what shapes the way I interact with the world.</p>
