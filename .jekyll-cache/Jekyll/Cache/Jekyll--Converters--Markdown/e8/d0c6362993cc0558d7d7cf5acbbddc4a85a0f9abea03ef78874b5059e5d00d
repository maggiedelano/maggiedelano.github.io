I"þ<p>I decided to switch from <a href="http://www.cadsoftusa.com/">Eagle</a> to <a href="http://www.altium.com/">Altium</a> for the next PCB I am designing for my PhD. While Altium is definitely a more professional tool, I found the startup time for my first design to be a bit longer than I would have liked. Below is a list of a few little things that seem simple in theory, but were non-intuitive for me to figure out the first time around (even with the help of google and the tutorial pdfs and videos).</p>
