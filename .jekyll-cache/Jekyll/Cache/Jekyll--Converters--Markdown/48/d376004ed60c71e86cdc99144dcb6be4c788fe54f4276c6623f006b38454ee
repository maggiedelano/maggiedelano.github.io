I"ı<p>About a year ago, I wrote <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2013-06-06-knowing-whats-important.html">this post</a> about identifying things that are important to me. Now that a year has passed, Iâ€™d like to take the time to reflect both on what I wrote a year ago and how Iâ€™ve been doing for the past year.</p>

<p>When I wrote my post a year ago, I was struggling to figure out what was important to me. I was lost and felt that I needed to search for more meaning in my life and be more deliberate about how I spend my time. While I certainly donâ€™t think I have everything completely sorted out today, I do feel much less lost now. I have a good sense of what is important to me, and Iâ€™ve taken strides toward realizing some of the goals I laid out a year ago.Â </p>

<p>I broke the things I consider to be most important to me into the categories of <strong>self-improvement</strong> , <strong>meaningful work</strong> , and <strong>quality time with friends and family</strong>. Iâ€™d say I still feel that way today.Â </p>

<p><strong>Self-Improvement:</strong></p>

<p>With self-improvement, I was specifically focused onÂ health,Â productivity, andÂ mindfulness.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Health</strong> : I set my health goals to be both â€œnot sickâ€ and â€œin shape.â€ I would say Iâ€™ve done reasonably well on both of these goals. Some parts of the year were definitely much better than others. I have been eating well, including experimenting with <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2014-05-05-reflections-after-a-month-of-veganism-during-the.html-week">a vegan during the week diet</a>. I also ran a number of races, including my first half marathon, and Iâ€™m getting ready to train for my first full marathon in November.</li>
  <li><strong>Productivity:Â </strong> I did not have formal goals for this last year, but I would say that I have definitely accomplished a lot this year, both research-wise and in general. I became an official PhD candidate, and created a second revision system for my thesis this year. However, while I do have times of hyperfocus, I also have times where Iâ€™m burned out and donâ€™t get much done.</li>
  <li><strong>Mindfulness:Â </strong> Iâ€™ve done OK at being more mindful, but not great. I have been keeping up with my reading (although I am a little behind now) and I am blogging about once a week, but I definitely havenâ€™t spent enough time on myself and reflecting as Iâ€™m realizing I need to be.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think I did OK in the area of self-improvement. There are concrete aspects that I think went really well at different times, but I definitely have found myself sacrificing being more productive in exchange for my health and my mindfulness.</p>

<p><strong>Meaningful work:</strong></p>

<p>With meaningful work, my goals for the past year were to focus specifically on research, building skills / learning, and community.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Research</strong> : I became a fully qualified PhD candidate this year, and am in the process of securing funding for the rest of my PhD. Iâ€™m getting ready to write my formal thesis proposal, in which I will lay out my plans for graduation. All in all, I think I made a lot of progress on research this year, although I still need to push myself a bit to get the project clearly defined and move forward in the next few years.</li>
  <li><strong>Building skills / learning:Â </strong> Iâ€™ve been doing well at learning new things, including participating in a number of book clubs, and taking a course on <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2014-04-27-readings-for-the-queer-soul.html">Queer Theory and Politics</a>. I have also gotten a lot more involved with the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> community and learned from a number of amazing people there.Â </li>
  <li><strong>Community:Â </strong> I have done a lot more for community this year. I am a member of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCIQtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fprojects.csail.mit.edu%2Feecsrefs%2F&amp;ei=8H6WU4HvBsubyASn8oLQDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNExre6H0vzuNk8TrmdiwbKXqjgzAQ&amp;sig2=7MZamtqjsRP4o2aOk81ybQ&amp;bvm=bv.68445247,d.aWw&amp;cad=rja">EECS REFS</a>Â and was just accepted as a <a href="http://studentlife.mit.edu/reslifeanddining/rlp/graduate-resident-tutors">Graduate Residence Tutor</a> at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/senior-house/www/">Senior House</a>. I am now a co-organizer of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/">Boston Quantified Self</a>, and started <a href="http://www.meetup.com/QSXX-Quantified-Self-Womens-Meetup-Boston/">Bostonâ€™s Quantified Self womenâ€™s meetup group</a>.Â </li>
</ul>

<p>I think I did really well when it came to focusing on meaningful work. However, I think Iâ€™m stretching myself thin on my involvement in community, and need to refocus my efforts on research now that Iâ€™m getting closer to graduation in 2-3 years.</p>

<p><strong>Quality Time with Friends and Family:</strong></p>

<p>I didnâ€™t give myself a specific goal or metric for this category (Iâ€™m thinking about what one might be, but Iâ€™m not sure yet). In the past year, Iâ€™ve made new connections and built relationships that are important to me. I started last summer in â€œmake all the friends possibleâ€ mode and met a lot of new people. However, Iâ€™ve struggled to build up these new relationships and to maintain existing ones. There have been a few people Iâ€™ve drifted apart from because we donâ€™t fit well into each otherâ€™s lives anymore, but more often than not I havenâ€™t maintained relationships with those I care about because Iâ€™ve been too busy.Â </p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>I think I came a long way in the past year as far as discovering more about myself and working on what is important to me. However, Iâ€™d say that I succeeded most in working on what is meaningful to me at the cost of time for myself and for those I care about.</p>

<p>Last year, I felt I didnâ€™t have enough meaning in my life. I was reasonably happy with myself and my relationships, but struggled most with my work and needed a sense of purpose. Now, I think I overcompensated and am happy with more of my work, but feel like Iâ€™ve committed to too much and need to step back and find some balance in my life. Everything Iâ€™m working on feels meaningful and important, but I need to pare down so I can focus on doing a subset of things well, rather than a larger set of things suboptimally.</p>

<p><strong>Things to consider:</strong></p>

<p>Overall, I still identify with my main areas of self-improvement, meaningful work, and quality time and their associated sub-goals. Moving forward for the next year, here are a few things Iâ€™m going to be more mindful of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Long-term vs. short-term:</strong> meaning is important to find, but it also important to consider work that is meaningful in the short-term vs. work that is meaningful in the long-term. Short-term work keeps me motivated now, but long-term work is what I can point to after I graduate. I find that the short-term work Iâ€™m doing is motivating for me, but can cause me to avoid dealing with the harder, but potentially more rewarding longer-term work.Â </li>
  <li><strong>Few vs. many:Â </strong> Doing more work makes me feel that what Iâ€™m working on has more meaning, but doing more work also means making less of an impact on each thing I do. Focus may be more important than diversity.Â </li>
  <li><strong>Balance, not meaning:Â </strong> I did a good job at finding meaningful work, but at the cost of balance. This year I should focus more on balance and worry less about meaning: there is only so much I can do and rather than trying to do more things, I should focus on what Iâ€™m already doing that has already a lot of meaning.</li>
</ul>
