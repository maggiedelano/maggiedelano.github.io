I"><p>I’ve always wanted to keep an active blog, but despite having this aspiration for many years and revisiting it over and over, I’ve realized that my ideal way of sharing information might take a different form. For the next few weeks I am experimenting with a <a href="/garden">digital garden</a>, focusing on curating pages and resources rather than writing discretized updates. Follow along there if you’d like to see what I’m up to. It took a little while longer to setup than I would have liked, so I’m sharing how I set it up to save others a headache.</p>
