I"­<p>Back in November I wrote up a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/maggied/Public/periodthezine.png">short piece</a> that was featured in <a href="http://blog.ameliagreenhall.com/post/period.-the-zine-released">period. the zine</a> on a period tracking experiment I have been doing. I started tracking my periods after I quit birth control and found that my cycle started syncing up with my roommateâ€™s after we moved in together. In the piece I chart out how the duration of my cycle changes over the months and begins to sync up. Iâ€™m still tracking now, but itâ€™s looking like my cycle is increasing in duration again and diverging to the 28 day cycle I was on for a few months. I do think itâ€™s pretty interesting that my period synced up, but only for a short period of time before getting longer again.</p>

<p>My roommate and I are going to continue our tracking, possibly with other additional data points as well, so stay tuned!</p>
