I"×<p>I decided to use what I learned in my <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2014-04-27-readings-for-the-queer-soul.html">Queer Theory and Politics</a> class this semester to draft an examination of the politics of self-tracking and Quantified Self (the group). It is still a work in progress (if you want to see it, contact me directly), but in the mean time I wanted to post a few links I found particularly helpful and/or interesting while writing.</p>
