I"à<p>Four and a half years ago I wrote <a href="https://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/2020/07/11/2014-06-10-doing-whats-important.html">this post</a> about my priorities and doing what was important to me at the time as a graduate student in the middle of her PhD. Fast forward to today, and I defended my PhD (over a year ago!) and have started a tenure track assistant professor position at Swarthmore College (hurray!). The last year has been a total whirlwind; I moved in early January 2018, turned in my thesis a few weeks later, and then started teaching about 4 days after that. Iâ€™ve been getting used to a new job, a new city, and just closed on a condo in December. Itâ€™s like jamming a whole ton of adulting all into one year.</p>
