I"<p>Grad school has been particularly stressful and hectic the past few months, so I’m super excited to be taking a 10 day vacation starting tomorrow. I’ll be flying to Portland, then to SF, then to Las Vegas, and then back home to Boston!</p>

<p>As I’ve been planning for my vacation, I’ve been thinking about what it means to take a “real” vacation. What do I need to do for myself to properly de-stress?</p>

<p>One thing I’ve noticed about myself is that checking email on vacation almost always winds up stressing me out. One frustrating email request or grade report, and I can get bent out of shape for the rest of the day when I’m supposed to be relaxing and enjoying myself.</p>

<p>I want this vacation to be different.</p>

<p>In an effort to allow myself to truly decompress, I’ve decided to pledge to check my email as infrequently as possible. And when I do check it, I’ll only check it for specific things like coordinating logistics with friends. I’m also leaving my laptop at home so I don’t get tempted to do any work or check my email.</p>

<p>As I’ve gotten closer to actually taking the vacation, I’ve been feeling nervous about <em>actually</em> committing to not checking my email. So I’ve been planning out how to make this pledge a reality.</p>

<p>Inspired by danah boyd’s article on <a href="http://web.mit.edu/maggied/www/resume_mkd.pdf">How To Take An Email Sabbatical</a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5836537/the-most-cleverest-vacation-auto-reply-e-mail-ive-seen">this</a> clever autoresponder message, here’s what I’ve done:</p>

<p><strong>Action Items and Collaborators:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Made a clear list of everything I’m working on and identified concrete milestones to complete before vacation.</li>
  <li>Completed those milestones as best as I could and sent a status update to anyone else involved.</li>
  <li>Told anyone I’m working on something with that I would be away on vacation starting a few weeks ago and that if they need anything from me, they should ask me before I leave.</li>
  <li>Roughly planned out what I want to do the week I get back and set a few reminders for myself, so I don’t feel totally swamped and stressed right after vacation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Travel Logistics:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Told anyone I think might need to contact me (such as people I’m meeting up with while traveling), that they should include maggie.delano+vacation@gmail.com on an email thread, and I’ll respond to their messages.</li>
  <li>Signed up for auto check-in for my flights and downloaded the United app to my phone so I have all my travel information accessible. </li>
  <li>Made a note in Evernote with all relevant addresses and confirmation numbers, so I don’t need to look them up in email and be tempted to break the pledge.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In Gmail:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Created a filter than applies the label “ruinyourvacation” to all incoming email and skips the inbox.</li>
  <li>Created a filter that applies the label “vacation” to any email sent to maggie.delano+vacation@gmail.com.</li>
  <li>Whitelisted a few specific email addresses.</li>
  <li>Enabled my autoresponder with a message that explains I’m on vacation, and to re-send the email to me only if it’s urgent, or there’s a good reason I need to see it (e.g. group logistics threads).</li>
  <li>Pre-applied the “vacation” label to existing logistics threads, in case I need to refer to them or forgot to put something on my Evernote note.</li>
  <li>Deleted the Gmail application from my phone.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite all this effort, I’ve still checked my email at least three times while writing this post. I think this will be a real challenge, but I’m interested to see where it goes. I’ll report back when I get home.</p>
