I"û<p>Four weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to start eating vegan more regularly. I decided to start eating exclusively vegan during the week, and let myself eat whatever I want on the weekend. The experiment has been going well so far, and I want to take the time to reflect on the past few weeks and walk through my motivations for this mostly-vegan diet.</p>

<p><strong>Why vegan?</strong></p>

<p>I had been thinking of going vegan for a while, but there were a few things that finally made me start doing it. I had the realization that going vegan is pretty much the best way to eat healthy, humane, and environmentally friendly all at once.Â I readÂ <a href="http://zenhabits.net/vegan/">this</a>Â article on Zen Habits and found it to be incredibly compelling. Leo appeals mostly to our need to be compassionate and help reduce animal suffering.Â Around the same time, I also attendedÂ <a href="http://www3.law.harvard.edu/orgs/foodlaw/themeatweeatforum/">The Meat We Eat: Forum on Industrial Animal Farming</a>, a conference put on byÂ <a href="http://www3.law.harvard.edu/orgs/foodlaw/">Harvardâ€™s Food Law Society</a>.Â <a href="http://www.ourhenhouse.org/2014/04/four-takeaways-from-the-meat-we-eat-2014-forum-on-industrial-animal-farming/">This</a>Â is a nice article summarizing some of the more salient points. At the conference, I learned more about the environmental impacts of the meat industry. One particularly powerful moment for me was learning that while grass-fed beef may be more humane than grain-fed beef, grass-fed cattle actually produce more methane than grain-fed cattle. Many believe that grass-fed cattle are actually worse for the environment (per cow), although this point is a bitÂ <a href="http://www.opb.org/news/blog/ecotrope/which-is-greener-grass-fed-or-grain-fed-beef/">controversial</a>. My takeaway from this was that while eating local, more humanely produced goods might make me feel good, it might come at a cost of a worsening impact on the environment. Locally sourced products arenâ€™t necessarily guaranteed to be better for the environment.</p>

<p>After I had already started being vegan during the week, Slate also ranÂ <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/feed_the_world/2014/05/meat_eating_and_climate_change_vegetarians_impact_on_the_economy_antibiotics.html">this</a>Â article on what would happen if everyone in the world went vegetarian or vegan. While the scenario of everyone all going vegan at once is pretty unrealistic, it does do a good job at exploring the impact of eating animal products on the world.</p>

<p><strong>Why vegan during the week?</strong></p>

<p>Once I decided I wanted to start eating vegan, I had to think about how I could effectively make the transition. Iâ€™m really busy with school right now, and I knew that changing my diet from no dietary restrictions to veganism would be difficult, especially since I havenâ€™t had much time to cook. I also knew going vegan would be hard because Iâ€™d miss eating certain foods, and it is much harder to eat with other people as a vegan.Â </p>

<p>I decided that I wouldnâ€™t go vegan full time, but would start easing myself into it. Iâ€™d read about bothÂ <a href="http://www.meatlessmonday.com/">Meatless Mondays</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385344740/?tag=slatmaga-20">Vegan Before 6</a>Â as strategies for eating more consciously without going full vegan, but I chose to be vegan during the week instead. While I havenâ€™t had much time to cook lately, Iâ€™ve also been eating most of my meals during the week by myself, so I realized that even if Iâ€™m buying my meals, I have enough control over where Iâ€™m eating that I could be vegan without too much hassle. Then when I spend time with other people on the weekend, I can eat what I want (often still choosing to eat vegan when I can).Â </p>

<p><strong>How has it gone?</strong></p>

<p>I found that being vegan during the week actually wasnâ€™t as bad as I thought it might be. I woke up one Monday morning and just decided to do it and see how long I could go for. After four weeks, Iâ€™d say it is going well enough that Iâ€™ll just stick with it.</p>

<p>One of the most challenging parts of being vegan has been finding vegetarian food without cheese in it. We Americans really love our cheese. Iâ€™ve found that I havenâ€™t really craved meat much, but that I have craved both cheese and chocolate. Fortunately, many dark chocolates are vegan, but I havenâ€™t tried any cheese substitutes, so Iâ€™ve mostly been allowing myself to indulge in cheese a bit on the weekends. Iâ€™ve also been eating eggs on the weekend for protein. I have to be much more mindful about making sure I eat enough protein during the week, because otherwise I can get pretty hungry and wind up snacking on a lot of carbs. As long as I keep myself full, Iâ€™ve found that I can manage any non-vegan food cravings pretty effectively. While I havenâ€™t been eating a super diverse set of foods, I actually enjoy what I have been eating, and look forward to meals still.</p>

<p>I wound up catching a cold during this experiment, so it is a little hard to comment on the impact of my veganism on my health and energy. I would say that eating vegan is having a great impact on my GI tract (probably all the fiber), and my skin has been pretty clear. I would say that my energy is definitely not any worse than before, and maybe even a bit better, although it is hard to tell.Â </p>

<p>My plan is to stick with my weekday veganism for now, and maybe start reducing my weekend indulgences as I get more used to it.Â </p>
