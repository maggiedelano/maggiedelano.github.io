This device removes all loose wires from the system and minimizes the footprint on the user. The monitor consists of five electrodes, which allow a cardiologist to choose from a variety of possible projections. Clinical tests to compare our wearable monitor with a commercial clinical ECG recorder are conducted on ten healthy adults under different ambulatory conditions, with nine of the datasets used for analysis. Data from both monitors were synchronized and annotated with PhysioNet's waveform viewer WAVE (physionet.org) [1]. All gold standard annotations are compared to the results of the WQRS detection algorithm [2] provided by PhysioNet. QRS sensitivity and QRS positive predictability are extracted from both monitors to validate the wearable monitor.},

	abstract = {A low-power, wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor was developed for long-term data acquisition and analysis. It was designed to maximize both comfort and ECG signal quality, and minimize obtrusiveness. The monitor consists of a central PCB that contains one electrode and most of the electronics. Two additional satellite PCBs house the remaining electrodes and buffer circuits and complete the system. It consumes 7.3 mW and can record single lead ECG for over one week under a variety of activity levels. A clinical test was performed to validate the monitor. Participants (N = 6) wore both the experimental cardiac monitor and a commercially available monitor while engaging in physical activities such as walking, stepping, and running. QRS sensitivity and QRS positive predictability were determined for each ECG waveform. The monitor performed as well or better than the commercial monitor in all interventions. It performed well even under high activity levels such as running, and may be a viable alternative to commercially available monitors.},

Monitoring patient fluid status using non-invasive techniques such as bioimpedance may help reduce CHF related read- mission rates. Bioimpedance measurements were performed in a controlled environment (hemodialysis) at two locations on the calf (side and back) to determine ideal electrode placement for monitoring changes in fluid status. Changes in calf bioimpedance were heterogeneous. Three out of seven patients had higher changes at the back of the calf compared with the side of the calf for the bioimpedance parameter \$R\_\{0\}\$ (the resistance measured at low frequency that is related to extracellular water). These data suggest there are differences in resistivity within the calf. Simulations showed that the use of point electrodes weights tissue nearest the electrodes more heavily, but that this dependence can be eliminated through the use of ring electrodes, effectively averaging resistivity around the calf.},

	abstract = {Abstract Objective: To evaluate the relationship between calf bioimpedance measurements and fluid removal in a controlled environment (hemodialysis) as a first step toward using these measurements for remote Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) monitoring. Approach: Calf bioimpedance measurements were recorded in 17 patients undergoing hemodialysis (9/17 (53\%) CHF, 5/17 (30\%) female). Measurements were performed before and after hemodialysis. Additional parameters related to hemodialysis and patient fluid status such as Estimated Dry Weight were also recorded. Main results: Calf bioimpedance changes depended on calf fluid status as assessed by calf normalized resistivity (CNR). Patients with lower calf fluid overload (as assessed by CNR greater than 0.1017 $\Omega$ m3/kg) had larger decreases in calf fluid than patients with higher calf fluid overload. High CNR patients had fluid changes within the calf that depended on the ultrafiltration rate, with patients with lower ultrafiltration rates experiencing fluid shifts from extracellular to intracellular fluid. Additionally, there were correlations between changes in calf extra-,intra- and total- water and the ultra- filtration volume removed for high CNR patients (R2 = 0.44, 0.42, 0.56, respectively, all p-values {\textless} 0.05). Significance: These results suggest that while the relationship between calf fluid status and total fluid status is complex, changes in calf volumes comparable to those expected in an ambulatory setting are measurable and relate to changes in total volume. This suggests that calf bioimpedance measurements for CHF remote monitoring warrant future investigation, as remote fluid status management could reduce fluid overload related hospitalizations in CHF patients.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.11.061},
	abstract = {To ensure optimal task performance, the human brain detects and resolves conflict in information processing via a cognitive control system. However, it is not known whether conflict resolution relies on a single central resource of cognitive control, or on a collection of independent control mechanisms that deal with different types of conflict. In order to address this question, we assessed behavioral and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses during the simultaneous detection and resolution of two sources of conflict in a modified color-naming Stroop task: conflict stemming from incompatibility between the task-relevant and an irrelevant stimulus feature (stimulus-based or Stroop conflict), and conflict stemming from incompatibility between an irrelevant stimulus feature and response features (response-based or Simon conflict). Results show that control mechanisms recruited by stimulus-based conflict resolve stimulus-based conflict, but do not affect the resolution of response-based conflict, and vice versa. The resolution of response-based conflict was distinguished by modulation of activity in premotor cortex, whereas resolution of stimulus-based conflict was distinguished by the modulation of activity in parietal cortex. These results suggest that the human brain flexibly adopts, and independently controls, conflict-specific resolution strategies, biasing motor programming to resolve response-based conflict, and biasing stimulus representations to resolve stimulus-based conflict. We propose a non-centralized, modular architecture of cognitive control, where separate control resources operate in parallel, and are recruited in a context-sensitive manner.},
